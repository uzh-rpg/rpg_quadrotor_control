## Instructions

Instructions for the installation and usage of this software is provided along with further details in our [Wiki](https://github.com/uzh-rpg/rpg_quadrotor_control/wiki). If you have questions or problems with this framework, please use the [issue tracker](https://github.com/uzh-rpg/rpg_quadrotor_control/issues). Please don't send us emails since they might not be answered.

## Summary

This repository contains a complete framework for flying quadrotors based on control algorithms developed by the [Robotics and Perception Group](http://www.ifi.uzh.ch/en/rpg.html).
We also provide an interface to the [RotorS](https://github.com/ethz-asl/rotors_simulator) Gazebo plugins to use our algorithms in simulation.
Together with the provided simple trajectory generation library, this can be used to test our sofware entirely in simulation.
We also provide some utility to command a quadrotor with a gamepad through our framework as well as some calibration routines to compensate for varying battery voltage.
Finally, we provide an interface to communicate with flight controllers used for First-Person-View racing.

The theory behind the included algorithms is summarized in the [theory document](https://github.com/uzh-rpg/rpg_quadrotor_control/blob/master/documents/theory_and_math/theory_and_math.pdf) contained in this repository as well as in our [RA-L18 Paper](http://rpg.ifi.uzh.ch/docs/RAL18_Faessler.pdf) with a technical report attached for further details as well as in our [RA-L17 Paper](http://rpg.ifi.uzh.ch/docs/RAL17_Faessler.pdf).

This repository makes use of some basic functionalities from the [rpg_quadrotor_common](https://github.com/uzh-rpg/rpg_quadrotor_common) repository and when working with real hardware, the GPIO and ADC functionalities in the [rpg_single_board_io](https://github.com/uzh-rpg/rpg_single_board_io) repository might come in handy.
